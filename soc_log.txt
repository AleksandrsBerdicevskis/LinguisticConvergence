This repository contains the data and the scripts that are necessary to reproduce the study described in the Nodalida 2023 paper:

You say tomato, I say the same: A large-scale study of linguistic accommodation in online communities

The source corpora containing Flashback posts are not provided. You can download the scrambled xml files from the Spr√•kbanken Text website and use the provided script large_xml_to_conllu2.rb to convert them to the conllu format. After that, they can be used as an input for the provided scripts.

The token frequency source file can be downloaded from here: http://demo.spraakdata.gu.se/sasha/flashback_uncased.zip. Unzip it and put it into the wordstats folder.

1. To reproduce the metric evaluation experiment (Section 2.3):

test_extract_users.rb: find 100 users for the evaluation experiment, create Text A and Text B (threshold = 3 * actual. If you want threshold 300, pass the value 900 to the script). You'll need flashback-fordon_sentence.conllu to run this file. 

test_mix_conllu_token.rb: mix the texts in each set, create 6 texts (threshold = 3 * actual). test_extract_users.rb must be run first.

test_delta.rb: run the ranking system (threshold = actual (pass 300 if you want 300)).
test_extract_users.rb and test_mix_conllu_token.rb have already been run, so you can run only test_delta.rb. It will use the files in the Sets10000-40000 folders.

test_wrapper2.rb will run all three scripts with all the settings (reproduce the whole experiment).

2. To reproduce the main experiment (Sections 2.4 and 3):

PATH soclingprox2.rb -- for every pair of users finds if they have had a necessary number of interactions, outputs that and info about interaction dates (outputs int files);
PATH extract_pairs.rb -- uses soclingprox2's output to extract the production of the relevant pairs and create the frequency vectors (outputs the pairs folders takes a lot of time due to reading huge CONLLU files);
process_pairs.rb -- uses extract_pairs' output to calculated distances and output the results (distances and summary files).
output dir: dist
CORRECT wrapper2.rb: runs all t LABELS

EXTRAS:
supersummary.rb = summarize the results in dist in a convenient table

ttests_dist.rb: run t-tests on the output in dist (currently int vs no-int). Not reported in the paper.
